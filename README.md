An example of one the pluggable forms


contains multiple pluggable forms that allows users to such as: 

- An IFrame file that imports a form that contains a progress bar as well as an IFrame that imports a form which does not contain a progress bar    

- Html file that imports the form from a separate html file whilst having the progress bar contained in the header of the main page. 
 
- html file that imports both the form and progress bar from a separate file.

- html file that imports the form from a separate html file whilst removing the progress bar in the header

- page that alerts the user that their loan is being processed.

also contains multiple assets files and folders such as:

- a JavaScript folder that contains multiple javascript files

- a font folder that contains the following files:

icons.ttf
icons.woff
icons.woff2

as well as an image folder that contains the following:

an logo.svg file
an manifest.json file
an norton-ssl.svg file that alerts the user that the form is protected through norton

other files include:

an application-rejected.html and an application-success.html file.
an decline-flexy.html that alerts the user that there applicaton has been rejected

There is also an example folder which holds both the iframe files as well as some of the assets files and images files as well a technical implementation guide to show users how to implement the forms correctly which [can be found on the wiki](https://github.com/quiddihub/dojono-form-development/wiki)
